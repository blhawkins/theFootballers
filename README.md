# Project Description

### [FIFA_Scraping.ipynb](https://github.com/blhawkins/theFootballers/blob/main/fifa_scraping.ipynb) and [Scrape_SoFIFA.py](https://github.com/blhawkins/theFootballers/blob/main/scrape_sofifa.py)
These files utilize Splinter and Beautiful Soup in order to scrape information from the [SoFIFA](https://sofifa.com/) soccer database. More specifically, information about the top 240 most valuable players, and the top 240 most highly rated club teams is stored. The Jupyter file shows the resulting dataset, and the Python file is used as a scraping function that is incorporated into the Flask application and PyMongo connection.
